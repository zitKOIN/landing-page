			<h1>FAQ</h1>
			<h2>Whats the purpose of the XZT?</h2>
			<p>XZT Coin will serve as the fuel for my lavish lifestyle I've always dreamed of. Driving 80s lambo, enjoying life and drawning my internal sadness 
			   in the huge fucking castle with bunch of people partying Gatsby Style</p>

			<h2>Who will buy the coin from me?</h2>
			<p>Your friends of course. Just tell them that you want to have a lavish life style as well and as long as you have true friends, they should buy the 
			XZT from you for a higher price than you have paid. Have friends = PROFIT, Don't have friends = MAKE SOME.</p>

			<h2>Does the XZT have any utility at all?</h2>
			<p>Not really. Maybe you'll receive an invitation for my amazing party or I'll stop by you on my road trip, or you know I'll allow you to spend a night in my amazing castle.</p>

			<h2>Exchanges?</h2>
			<p>ZitKOIN is an ERC20 token, so you can trade via EtherDelta, ForkDelta or you know, meet with your friends and trade in person. Also I don't really care...</p>

			<h2>Softcap, hardcap?</h2>
			<p>No softcap. I'm selling a total of 1.000.000.000 zitKOINs. Well not all of it, some I'll keep for myself, because that's what other kids do. Rate will be adjusted during the sale so that we reach aproximately 15million for the hardcap, maybe more, depends on how much we spend on that Great Gatsby party tbh.</p>

			<h2>Team members? Advisors?</h2>
			<p>It's mostly me. There are some people with what could be called an advisory role, but I'm not paying them shit...They will get tokens, but that's not real money or is it?</p>

			<h2>When does the tokensale start?</h2>
			<p>03/13/2018 @ 11:00am (UTC)</p>

			<h2>When does the tokensale end?</h2>
			<p>04/30/2018 @ 10:00am (UTC) - i want to drive my lambo over the summer. </p>

			<h2>When will I be able to sell my coins?</h2>
			<p>Coins or tokens or whatever you wanna call them will be transferable after the ICO ends.</p>

			<h2>Should I invest?</h2>
			<p>Probably not, but please do. I really want that castle.</p>
